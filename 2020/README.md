# Advent of Code 2020

## Day 1

Using [recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion#In_computer_science) when summing numbers in order to fix an expense report. The recursive solution can sum an arbitrary amount of numbers, and therefore scales nicely, compared to brute-force solutions like nesting for loops.

## Day 2

Using `map` and `filter`, together with [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) and [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), to validate passwords.

## Day 3

Using `modulo` to simulate an infinitely repeating map when counting trees.

## Day 4

Using `map`, `filter` and `reduce`, together with [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) and [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), to validate passports.
