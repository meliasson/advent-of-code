# Advent of Code 2020

JS. All in on some best practices like TDD (Mocha), automatic linting (ESLint), code formatting (Prettier) and a little bit of CI (lint and test on push to GitHub via GitHub Actions).

## Day 1: Report Repair

Using [recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion#In_computer_science) when summing numbers in order to fix an expense report. The recursive solution can sum an arbitrary amount of numbers, and therefore scales nicely, compared to brute-force solutions like nesting for loops.

## Day 2: Password Philosophy

Using map and filter, together with [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) and [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), to validate passwords.

## Day 3: Toboggan Trajectory

Using modulo to simulate an infinitely repeating map when counting trees.

## Day 4: Passport Processing

Using map, filter and reduce, together with [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) and [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), to validate passports.

## Day 5: Binary Boarding

Using only two integers, as upper and lower bounds, together with the boarding pass, when iteratively determining row and column. A recursive solution would probably have been even more elegant than the iterative. Maybe next time.

## Day 6: Custom Customs

Using a simple object, together with map and reduce, to store and count answers.

## Day 7: Handy Haversacks

Using [recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion#In_computer_science) to traverse tree-like structures with ease.
