# Advent of Code 2022 in PowerShell

Another year, first stab at (Or is it with? Maybe both.) PowerShell!

## Workflow

1. Start devcontainer in VS Code.
2. TDD a solution using Pester and the given example test case.
3. Feed real input into solution and submit result.
4. Depending on result, 🥳 or go on a 🐛 hunt.
